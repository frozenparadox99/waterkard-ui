<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Objective
To create an inventory management system for vendors selling water jars in order to track orders, loaded and unloaded jars, payments and missing jars.

## Background

- For small to midsize vendors selling water jars, tracking of each order and general bookkeeping is not practiced in an organized manner
- Low turnover is also a contributing factor for lack of infrastructure in inventory management.
- Drivers tend to exploit this by stealing some jars which further reduces profit margins.
- Taking orders is mainly done manually. 
- Competitive hijacking is also prevalent due to the sharing of information through drivers. 

## Users of the App
- Vendors who sell water jars (18L and 20L), who need to have a central source of truth for all activities corresponding to their stock of jars.

## Features
- Customer, vendor and driver registration in order to have a central database and application for inventory management of water jars 
- We track orders, inventory loaded in vehicles, inventory in godowns and final unloading inventory and payments.
- Inventory Controls: Based on live inventory data in vehicles and godown, we show the missing jars as well
